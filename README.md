Survival Analysis 


In this homework I tried to build a CLV model for a telecommunications company using parametric models. 
I have built ATF models using different distributions: Weibull, Log-Normal, Log-Logistic, Exponential, Generalized Gamma. 
Out of these models, I've selected the best model one as the final model for CLV calculation.

After choosing the final model and calculating the CLV per customer using the model, 
I've included the report of the analysis in the ipynb file :)
